# 🎓 DSA Capstone Project: Palmora Group HR Analytics

This repository contains my capstone project for the **Data Skills Accelerator (DSA)** program. It focuses on solving a real-world HR analytics case for Palmora Group, a Nigerian manufacturing company, using Power BI.

The project addresses organizational issues such as **gender inequality**, **pay gaps**, and **performance-based bonus allocation**, through data visualization and insights generation.

Palmora Group came under public scrutiny after a media report accused the company of being a male-dominated organization. As part of a consulting team, I was tasked with analyzing their employee dataset and identifying gender-related imbalances, salary structures, and bonus payouts across three regions in Nigeria.
